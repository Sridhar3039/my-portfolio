          Hi, I'm Sridhar R, a passionate <span>Java Full Stack Developer</span>{" "}
          skilled in building dynamic web applications using React.js, Spring
          Boot, JDBC, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently completed a
          full stack development internship at <span> Cloudisian </span>, where
          I worked on real-time projects that strengthened my understanding of
          both front-end and back-end development.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in Java and modern web technologies, I enjoy
          solving problems and turning <span> ideas into functional </span>,
          user-friendly applications. I'm actively seeking a full-time
          opportunity where I can contribute to{" "}
          <span> innovative projects </span>, grow with a supportive team, and
          continuously improve my skills in full stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To strengthen my fundamentals, I completed a Java Full Stack
          Development course at <span> Pentagon Space</span>, where I gained
          hands-on experience in Java, JDBC, JSP, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React.js, and MySQL. This course helped me build a strong
          technical base and prepared me for real-world project work.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my internship, I gained valuable experience working
          independently — from designing{" "}
          <span>
            responsive UI components in React to developing RESTful APIs using
            Spring Boot{" "}
          </span>
          . I also worked with MySQL for managing application data and used
          tools like GitHub for version control and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m constantly learning and staying updated with the latest
          technologies in web development. I believe in writing clean,
          maintainable code and following best practices that ensure long-term
          scalability.{" "}
          <span> Whether it’s frontend interactions or backend </span>
          performance, I enjoy delivering complete and efficient web solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m excited to contribute to a fast-paced team where I can learn from
          experienced developers, take ownership of meaningful tasks, and make a
          real impact. My goal is to grow as a developer by working on
          challenging projects that push me to think creatively and improve
          every day.
